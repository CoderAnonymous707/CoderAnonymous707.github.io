			Tamil is said to be one of the oldest languages in the world. Over 77 million people in the world speak Tamil.
			It is the official language in India (Tamil Nadu), Singapore and Sri Lanka. It is the 17th largely spoken
			language in the world (though it might not seem like a big record) and is spoken widely for more than 5,000 
			years and is said to have the power of 'renewing' itself for generations to come by creating new tamil words
			in various fields of technology, engineering, science, maths, and more. 
			</p>
			<h3 id = "chola-dynasty">The Chola Dynasty</h3>
			<p>
			The powerful age of tamils came in the form of the Chola dynasty. It was a kingdom found in the south of India 
			(covering most of present day Tamil Nadu) and is said to be one of the first kingdoms in the world for naval
			supremacy along the Indian Ocean. It was during the Chola Period that Tamil spread to many of the South Asian states. 
			Hints of tamil in the form of tamil words and pronounciation can be seen in many South Asian languages such as Korean. 
			Along with the language, cultural trade occured at a large scale among the Chola Dynasty and the other South Asian countries
			like Korea, Indonesia, and many others from the Australasian Island group. This facilitated the sharing of ideas and traditions
			within the kingdoms.

			The Chola Dynasty was one of the longest ruling dynasties in the world history. The main river of the Chola Dynasty was the 
			Kaveri River. Its (her)	richness, fertility, and the beauty of this river has been praised and described in many Tamil 
			compositions. This dynasty slowly became powerful in millitary, economy, culture and navy in the whole of Southern Asia.

			The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in the building of temples has 
			resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture. The medieval Cholas are best known for the construction 
			of the magnificent Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by the most famous Chola king, Rajaraja Chola in 1010 C.E.
			There are still mysteries about the technology the Cholas implemented in construction. It is still a mystery so as to how 
			the Cholas raised the 'gopuram' (The dome on top of the temple) of the Brihadivara temple for such a great height! At such an 
			early age, the usage of such technology is pretty impressive! This evidence, and many more prove the smartness of the Tamils 
			and the Cholas, which made them comquer a large mass of area and sustain for a long time.

			The Temples and the Grand Architecture constructed by the Cholas till now have never faded away, or destroyed or had any 
			kind of damage.
			From 1216 the Hoysala kings of present day Karnataka, obtained lands in the Chola country, former Chola feudatories 
			threw off their allegiance, northern powers intervened, and the upheaval facilitated the Pandya conquest of the Chola 
			country in 1257. The Chola dynasty ended in 1279. The Grand Kingdom was Lost, but never forgotten. It still now influences 
			the way people think and it is still in the blood of the Tamils (if not biologically, then traditionally). The pride and power 
			of the kingdom is still remembered by the people of the world.

			<p>
			Tamil Literature is one of the oldest literatures in the world. Even tamils may not be able to understand the old compositions
			due to their lack of knowledge in old tamil. The evolution of tamil script is very drastic. The script known as the tamil script
			was very different from today. Many tamil scholars work at decrypting old tamil script in inscriptions and deriving old
			compositions and poems (songs and sonnets). From Devotion to Romantics, there are various kinds of compositions found in Tamil. 
			<br><br>
			Tamil has originated from the submarine continent of Lemuria (Kumarikandam in Tamil) in the Indian Ocean just like Atlantis in 
			the Atlantic Ocean. Many hymns and compositions in tamil have vanished due to the destruction of Lemuria. But still, abundant Tamil
			Literature, which has been grown through the times, can be found on earth. 
			<br>
			Some of the famous tamil literatures are:

			Thiruvalluvar (<span class = "tamil">திருவள்ளுவர் </span> - Meaning a great scholar) whose name is yet a mystery. This book 
			1,330 short couplets about how to lead our life, good morals and philosophy. It consists of 133 chapters relating to love, 
			morals, faith, truthfulness, generosity, education and much more. Thiruvalluvar is considered to be a great scholar and
			wisdom wizard due to his knowledge on the facts of life. His couplets are 100% relatable to a man's life in this generation. 
			People say that reading a couplet a day from the Thirukkural will completely change a man's life in a positive way. Many 
			compositions and poems in Tamil praising Thirukkural! Thirukkural is also known as the Ulagapodhumarai (meaning a composition
